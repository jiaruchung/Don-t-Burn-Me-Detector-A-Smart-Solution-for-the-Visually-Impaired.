Project title
Don’t Burn Me Detector: A Smart Solution for the Visually Impaired.

Description
The use of this system is to guide users with visual impairment to properly target the
containers such as a cup or mug before the liquid is poured, without using a finger to detect
where the mug is or where the liquid line is and to avoid possible burning issues. Don’t Burn Me
Detector: A Smart Solution for the Visually Impaired is a sensor that can 1) indicate when the
object, the bottle is approaching the cup glass so that the user can know when it is safe to pour,
2) indicate when the liquid has reached the level that has to be stopped or it will spill or overflow.
